<h1 style="font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 55px; text-align: center"> Internet Search</h1>
<p style="color: black; font-size: medium; font-family: 'Courier New';">
    Big companies tried to solve the navigation (search) problem like Yahoo and Excite. While the internet was full of information, it was tough to find what you 
    needed unless you already knew the page or were able to find additional links from within a page. Yahoo was founded on the creators desire to get sports info 
    for fantasy leagues. They compiled a list of websites with useful resources for what they were looking for. They were able to get a lot of traffic and knew 
    just how desired search and compilation was, but needed money for growth and expansion. This made them briefly forget the idea of search as they added other 
    functions like email to gain an edge of Excite, who were able to match them stride for stride initially trying to compete as the better search company. 
    Excite had figured out a more efficient means of searching the web before Yahoo through means of software queries as opposed to manual categorizing. Google 
    then came into play and utilized a voting system to link websites. When a person navigates from page A to page B, that casts a “vote”. Their idea is that 
    the websites visited the most were the most relevant in their case. Pages with the most votes were suggested before pages with less votes. Google was able to 
    get about $25 million in funding from several sources, the main one being John Doerr who was a name in the industry and also funded companies like Amazon, 
    Netscape, and Compaq. Google was in need of revenue and refused to clutter the page with banner ads like Yahoo had. They wanted a nice user experience. 
    Their plan to make money was to sell keywords to advertisers. For example, if a user searched up “cars”, there’s a strong chance that the user is in the market 
    for a new car to buy. Car companies could then pay Google to have their storefront or pages listed higher on the search results and making the user believe 
    that is the most relevant of the bunch. Their final idea was to separate the organic search results from the ads. Google went public in 2004 and has remained 
    strong and profitable ever since.
